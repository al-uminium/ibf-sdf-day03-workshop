# Introduction
The workshop aims to create a simple shopping cart based on the terminal with the following commands:
- login
- add
- list
- save
- users
- exit

The list is saved within a file called shoppingcart.db locally. 

## Usage of the application
The application can be run by doing the following: 

```bash
java shoppingcart.jar [directory of your carts]
```

If no directory is given, it will be defaulted to "cartdb".


## Compiling and Running the JAR file
I'll be adding this later.
